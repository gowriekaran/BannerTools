Please make sure your ad container is using the ID: 'adContainer' or 'ad-container'.
Please make sure your replay button is using the class: 'replay_btn' or 'replay-button'.


- Screenshot
   It's usable..

It sets the margin of ad container to 0, waits a second and captures a screenshot of your ad from the origin 0,0. So if you're wondering why it's moving left and right, that's why. 
And the quality isn't as good as taking a screenshot and saving it as web legacy through photoshop. 
There may be times where you would need to use Tinypng. 
And photoshop throws an error when trying to edit the captured photo..... 
Like I said, it's still in works, but it's usable...
